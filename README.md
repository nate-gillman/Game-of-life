# Game-of-life
A Python implementation of John Conway's cellular automaton, the Game of Life.

This humble program was my first coding project. I completed it when I was a freshman undergraduate at Wesleyan University in January 2017, and it was a ton of fun to work on. I decided to upload this onto GitHub because John Conway passed away in April 2020 of complications from Covid-19. His mathematical achievements and creativity were an inspiration to me when I was starting my mathematical journey, and I hope that by sharing my implementation of his most notable invention, I can help keep his creations alive. 

I can think of no better way for me to celebrate the life of John Conway than by sharing my implementation of John Conway's celebrated Game of Life.

This program runs on Python 3.8.5. Hope you enjoy!!
