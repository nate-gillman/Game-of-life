# Game-of-life
A Python implementation of John Conway's cellular automaton, the Game of Life.

# How to play?

```
conda create -n game_of_life_env python=3.8
conda activate game_of_life_env
pip install tk==0.1.0
python game_of_life.py
```

# Why did I make this?

This humble program was my first coding project. I completed it when I was a freshman undergraduate at Wesleyan University in January 2017, and it was a ton of fun to work on. I decided to share it as a public repo after John Conway passed away in April 2020 of complications from Covid-19. His mathematical achievements and creativity were an inspiration to me when I was starting my math/cs journey, and I hope that by sharing my implementation of his most notable invention, I can help keep his creations alive. 

I can think of no better way for me to celebrate the life of John Conway than by sharing my implementation of John Conway's celebrated Game of Life.

Hope you enjoy!!
